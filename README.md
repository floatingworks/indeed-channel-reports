# indeed-channel-reports
creates a csv file with list of channels and total earnings

## Getting started
Download script and run
``
python channels.py
``

### Usage
If you run an indeed jobroll or use the indeed api to post jobs. If you have multiple channels of data, this script will produce a list of the channels under your dashboard with their earnings in a csv file for the current month

#### TODO
Create a date range to download for. Currently it downloads the current month only. This would require multiple requests so will be slow.
